    <h1>7 Hidden Android Features You Never Knew Existed (2025 Edition)</h1>
    <p>Explore the secret powers of your Android phone that make everyday life easier and smarter.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Android has grown so advanced that even longtime users haven’t scratched the surface of what their phones can do.
      Hidden deep inside your settings are small but powerful features that can save battery, protect your privacy,
      and even make your device faster. Here are seven that most people don’t even know exist.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Smart Lock — Unlock Without Touching</h2>
    <p>
      Do you know you can keep your phone unlocked in safe zones like your home or when it detects your face or voice?
      Smart Lock uses trusted devices or locations to automatically unlock your phone when it’s safe — no PINs or patterns.
      Go to <b>Settings → Security → Smart Lock</b> and set your trusted places or devices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Guest Mode — Hide Your Personal Stuff Instantly</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes friends or kids ask for your phone, and you panic because of what’s on it 😅.
      Use <b>Guest Mode</b> to switch to a clean profile where your messages, photos, and apps are hidden.
      You’ll find it in <b>Settings → System → Multiple users → Guest</b>. One tap and your secrets are safe.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Screen Pinning — Lock Someone to One App</h2>
    <p>
      Ever handed your phone to someone to show a photo, and they started scrolling through your gallery? 🙃  
      You can pin one app so the person can’t leave it. Enable it under <b>Settings → Security → Screen Pinning</b>.
      Then open an app, tap the multitasking view, and pin it. No more nosy hands!
    </p>

    <h2>4. Digital Wellbeing Focus Mode</h2>
    <p>
      Need to study or work without distractions? Focus Mode blocks apps you choose until you turn it off.
      You’ll find it in <b>Settings → Digital Wellbeing & Parental Controls → Focus Mode</b>.
      It’s a productivity hack hidden in plain sight.
    </p>

    <div class="tip">
      💡 <b>Pro Tip:</b> Combine Focus Mode with Do Not Disturb for deep work sessions — your phone becomes distraction-free.
    </div>

    <h2>5. Notification History — See What You Missed</h2>
    <p>
      Ever swiped away a notification too fast and regretted it? Android has your back.
      Turn on <b>Notification History</b> under <b>Settings → Notifications → Notification History</b> and you’ll always be able to see
      dismissed alerts from the last 24 hours.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Hidden Developer Options</h2>
    <p>
      Want to make your phone feel faster? Go to <b>Settings → About Phone → Build Number</b> and tap it 7 times to unlock
      Developer Options. Then lower the animation scale values to 0.5x — your phone will suddenly feel twice as fast.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Clipboard Access Alert (Privacy Boost)</h2>
    <p>
      On newer Android versions, whenever an app reads your clipboard, Android alerts you.
      This protects you from shady apps trying to steal copied passwords or text.
      Check this in <b>Settings → Privacy → Advanced → Clipboard Access</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These hidden gems show how powerful Android has become — it’s not just a phone anymore, it’s a smart personal assistant waiting
      to be explored. If you found something new here, share this post and tag a friend who always says they “know Android inside out.” 😎
